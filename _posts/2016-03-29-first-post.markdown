Hello, I'm Shane Gerhardt.

This site is hosted by GitHub pages and built with Jekyll. Check back here
for code snippets and 'how to' posts on some of my favorite front end development
techniques.

I went through a number of different setups for building this site. In 2008 it was built with dreamweaver. From there, I switched to sublime and basic html but I finally decided to build the site on top of Jekyll.

I decided on Jekyll because it allowed for easy updates and free hosting on GitHub.
