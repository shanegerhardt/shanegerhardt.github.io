Hello, I'm Shane Gerhardt.

This site is hosted by github pages and is built with jekyll. Check back here
for code snippets and how to posts on some of my favorite front end development
techniques and tools.

I went through a number of different setups for building my site. Originally it was in dreamweaver, then hand coded in sublime, built on jekyll, a custom setup following google material design, but then back to jekyll.

I decided on jekyll because it allowed for a simple design and easy updates.
