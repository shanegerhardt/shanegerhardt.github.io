Today one of my coworkers shared a link to a collection of how to videos by [Wes Bos][wesbos] called [javascript30][javascript30].
The purpose of this course is to build 30 things in 30 days using only vanilla javascript.

After browsing the course list, it seemed like the projects were fun and interesting; the perfect way to brush up on my vanilla javascript skills. The first few courses, as expected, are very simple so when I can I will be adding my own extra credit to each project. You can check out the projects as I add them to my [projects][projects] page or view a list of all of them [here][allprojects]
