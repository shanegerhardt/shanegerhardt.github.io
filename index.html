    <p>My name is Shane Gerhardt.</p>

<h2>Present</h2>
<p>Currently I’m working as a front end developer at <a href="http://www.pbhs.com">PBHS</a> building the best dental/medical custom Wordpress sites in the field.</p>

<h2>Past</h2>
<p>While I’m working as a front end developer, my background is actually in Computer Science.
I received my B.S. in Computer Science from San Francisco State University in 2013, where I studied Object Oriented Programming, Agile development, database design, and other programming topics such as data types and data structures.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>
<p>My real passion in programming is working with mobile applications. Consumers spend <a href="http://tcrn.ch/1LwiWfU">85% of their phone time</a> on using apps, and that number will only increase. I developed and deployed a mobile app for Windows Phone that saw over a thousand downloads, and I have developed other small proof of concept apps for iPhone and Windows Phone that I haven’t released. My passion for mobile apps is what lead to my career in front end development. Even though native apps are king for the moment, I believe the future of mobile applications is on the web.</p>

<h2>You're all caught up</h2>
<p>
  My programming background gives me a unique point of view in developing websites, specifically in writing CSS.
  I have a modular approach to css that minimizes repeating code and makes maintaining the css much easier, even coming back to the project months later.
  I also am very familiar with the backend and am able to use that to my advantage.

<p>You can see a few of the websites I’m proud of, as well as my other creations, on the <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.</p>
