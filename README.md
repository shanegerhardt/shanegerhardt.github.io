Hi, I’m Shane Gerhardt, a Senior Software Engineer from California with over a decade of experience building and scaling web platforms.

## Experience

### Senior Software Engineer — RevenueWell (2021–Present)

When RevenueWell acquired PBHS, I joined the engineering team to help evolve our website platform for thousands of dental practices. I’ve focused on scaling the system, modernizing the stack, and building smarter tools for both clients and our internal teams.

- Built [EvaluateMyPractice.com](https://evaluatemypractice.com), a tool that helps dental practices see how their online presence stacks up. It reviews online listings, customer reviews, website speed, and security, then gives a score and local ranking. It’s been a powerful tool for helping our sales team close new website clients.
- Created an analytics dashboard that brings together data from Google Analytics, Ads, and Meta. It helps our clients see their marketing performance clearly while giving our team a complete view across every account. It also handles our monthly report generation and delivery to all clients.
- Built and maintained a custom SEO management system deployable across 5,000+ clients.
- Expanded reputation management product to support automated Twilio/SendGrid review campaigns.
- Replaced Google Maps with an alternative solution for a 10× yearly cost reduction across clients.

### Senior Software Engineer — PBHS (2019–2021)

Shifted focus from individual sites to platform architecture, unifying design systems and improving developer tooling for our WordPress ecosystem.

- Developed a block-based templating engine using server-side rendering for unified design.
- Created a CLI migration tool to move 5,000+ client sites from AWS to a WordPress-specific host.
- Led the modernization of our client admin panel, migrating from Angular to a Vue SPA.

### Web Developer — PBHS (2015–2019)

Developed 4–6 custom WordPress themes per month with a focus on performance, customization, accessibility, and client satisfaction.

### Maintenance Developer — PBHS (2014–2015)

Performed website updates, bug fixes, and maintenance tasks while supporting a growing client base.

### Support Specialist — PBHS (2014)

Helped clients solve issues with websites and online patient forms, developing strong troubleshooting skills early on.
