My Portfolio Landing Page

## Goals
The main goal for this site is to showcase what I've been working on. 
I wanted a place to archive my past, present, and future projects as well as a place to post articles with helpful web dev tips and tricks.

As a secondary goal, I've challenged myself to utilize best practices (no render blocking resources, minified files, etc) in developing this site.
You might notice the design is more simplistic than most portfolio sites, but I want the page size of the site to be as small as possible and a simplistic design facilitates that.
The solid content you find here should outweigh the simpler design.
