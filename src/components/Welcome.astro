        Hi, I’m Shane Gerhardt, a Senior Software Engineer from California with
        over a decade of experience building and scaling web platforms. My roots
        are in WordPress, but I’ve grown into a systems-focused engineer who
        loves improving performance, reliability, and developer experience
        across large, multi-tenant platforms.

        <h3>Senior Software Engineer — RevenueWell (2021–Present)</h3>
        <p>
            When RevenueWell acquired PBHS, I joined the engineering team to
            help evolve our website platform for thousands of dental practices.
            I’ve focused on scaling the system, modernizing the stack, and
            building smarter tools for both clients and our internal teams.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Built <a

                    rel="noopener">EvaluateMyPractice.com</a
                >, a tool that helps dental practices see how their online
                presence stacks up. It reviews online listings, customer
                reviews, website speed, and security, then gives a score and
                local ranking. It’s been a powerful tool for helping our sales
                team close new website clients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Created an analytics dashboard that brings together data from

                marketing performance clearly while giving our team a complete
                view across every account. It also handles our monthly report
                generation and delivery to all clients.
            </li>

                across 5,000+ clients.

            <li>
                Expanded reputation management product to support automated
                Twilio/SendGrid review campaigns.
            </li>
            <li>
                Replaced Google Maps with an alternative solution for a 10×
                yearly cost reduction across clients.
