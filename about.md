My name is Shane Gerhardt.

## Present
Currently I'm working as a front end developer at [PBHS](http://www.pbhs.com) building the best dental/medical custom Wordpress sites in the field.

## Past
While I'm working as a front end developer, my background is actually in Computer Science.
I received my B.S. in Computer Science from San Francisco State in 2013, where I studied Object Oriented Programming, Agile development, database design, and other computer science topics such as data types and data structures.

## Future
My real passion in programming is working with mobile applications. Consumers spend [85% of their phone time](http://tcrn.ch/1LwiWfU) on using apps, and that number will only increase. I developed and deployed a mobile app for Windows Phone that saw over a thousand downloads, and I have developed other small proof of concept apps for iPhone and Windows Phone that I haven't released. My passion for mobile apps is what lead to my career in front end development. Even though native apps are king for the moment, I believe the future of mobile applications is on the web.

## Front End Science
My programming background gives me a unique point of view in developing websites, specifically in writing CSS. I have a modular approach to css that minimizes repeating code and makes maintaining the css much easier, even months later. I also am very familiar with the backend and am able to use that to my advantage.  

You can see a few of the websites I'm proud of, as well as my other creations, on the [projects page](/projects).
